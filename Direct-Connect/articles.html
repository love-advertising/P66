<p style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">As winter weather settles in and before you get ready for traveling over the holidays, it&rsquo;s crucial that your vehicle is well-prepared for the challenges posed by colder temperatures, icy roads, and inclement weather. Taking the time to perform a few key checks and maintenance tasks can keep you safe on winter roads.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">Create a checklist and prepare your car for winter travel:</p>

    <li>
        <strong>Tire Pressure and Tread</strong>
        <br>
        Cold weather can cause tire pressure to drop, so check the pressure regularly and keep it at the recommended level. Also, inspect the tread depth to ensure that your tires can maintain good traction on slippery surfaces. Consider switching to winter or snow tires if you live in an area with heavy snowfall.

        <strong>Windshield Wipers and Fluid</strong>
        <br>
        Replace worn-out blades and ensure that they can effectively clear snow and ice from your windshield. Additionally, use winter-grade windshield washer fluid that won’t freeze in cold temperatures. It’s essential to have a clear view of the road to navigate safely through winter conditions.

        <strong>Battery Inspection</strong>
        <br>
        Check your battery for signs of corrosion and ensure that the connections are secure. If your battery is more than three years old, consider having it tested by a professional. Cold temperatures can significantly impact a weak battery, leading to potential starting issues.

        <strong>Brake Inspection</strong>
        <br>
        Ensure that your brakes are in good working order, as stopping distances can increase on icy or snow-covered roads. Check brake pads and discs for wear and have them replaced if necessary. A well-maintained braking system is crucial for safe winter driving.

        <strong>Oil Change</strong>
        <br>
        Consider switching to a winter-grade oil that is formulated to perform better in lower flowing temperatures. A 5W-30 or 0W-30 will give better protection in winter weather than a 10W-40 or a 20W-50, while still providing solid high-temperature protection. Consider asking for a synthetic or synthetic blend motor oil, we recommend using our Kendall and Phillips 66 oils to keep your car winter ready!
