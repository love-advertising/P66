<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">In early 2018 we updated our large and small package labels to the current templates for Phillips 66 and Kendall. During that comprehensive review, we not only made several regulatory improvements, but also took advantage of the opportunity to provide some additional enhancements. One of these enhancements might not have been widely appreciated at the time but has since become a fixture in our contemporary lives: the QR code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">QR codes are featured on every label, whether it's on a large pack style like totes, drums, kegs, or pails, or a smaller package such as bag-in-box, jugs, or quarts. A simple scan using your smartphone's camera grants you immediate access to the dedicated product page for the lubricant. Here, both you and your customers can readily access pertinent product information and quickly find links to the Technical Data Sheet, Safety Data Sheet, and details about our best-in-class limited product warranty</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black;">Providing the information to customers could help reduce some administrative requests&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;">for supporting documents like the SDS or TDS. The information is just a quick scan away. Below are some examples of various package labels with the QR code highlighted (look for them near the UPCs) as well as an example of the destination web page with the &ldquo;Links of Interest&rdquo; highlighted in green. If you have questions, please consult your sales manager. </span><strong><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: black; display: none;">Top of FormBottom of Form</span></strong></p>
